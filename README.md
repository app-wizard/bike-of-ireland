## Creation process

### 1.Strategy

The website is designed and operates according to the "business-to-consumer" (B2C) model. Its main purpose is to provide information about the company's services and present the company to the consumer.

### 3.Design

Using Figma I created the design for my site: [here](/assets/img/figma.png)

### 4.Surface

To enhance readability and create an engaging design, I plan to utilize Google Fonts and select two highly legible typefaces. This choice aims to ensure that the title captivates attention while maintaining easy readability for the main text. For the color scheme, I intend to incorporate various shades of blue for both the background and text. It is important to consider contrast recommendations to guarantee optimal legibility, adjusting the text color based on the background color.

## Features 

### Header + Nav

The header of the main page features a logo and navigation menu that includes links to different sections, namely:

# Testing

## HTML Validator 

Initially, the HTML code failed to pass validation due to the duplication of the border in both the <iframe> and <div> elements. However, after rectifying the code based on the recommendations, the necessary corrections were made, and the validation was successfully passed.

## CSS Validator

During the development process, I made several adjustments to the CSS code in order to ensure that it passed CSS validation without any errors. By continuously refactoring the CSC code, I was able to address any potential issues and maintain a clean and error-free stylesheet.

## Lighthouse

To assess the loading speed of my website, I utilized Google DevTools Lighthouse to conduct performance testing. In order to enhance the download performance, I made necessary adjustments such as resizing the images. This approach allowed me to strike a balance between image quality and download speed, ensuring that the website loads efficiently without compromising visual appeal.

## Manual testing

I thoroughly tested and developed this website using Mac Safari as my primary browser. However, I also verified its functionality and compatibility on Chrome and Microsoft Edge, and I'm pleased to confirm that it works perfectly on all these platforms.

Additionally, I performed tests on mobile devices, specifically an iPhone 11 and Samsung S22. For other mobile devices, I utilized Google DevTools to simulate their displays and ensure optimal responsiveness and appearance. This comprehensive testing approach guarantees a seamless and enjoyable user experience across different browsers and devices.

## Issues and their solutions

I faced challenges in maintaining visual appeal while resizing the screen, as it was crucial to ensure consistent style across a wide range of devices, from iPhone 4 to high-resolution 4K monitors and beyond. However, after multiple factors, I successfully achieved the desired outcome, adopting the content to various screen sizes without compromising the aesthetics of the website.

Additionally, I encountered an issue with the form functionality during the development stage, as there was no backend available for testing. To overcome this obstacle, I utilizes the service provided by https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts. This allowed me to simulate form submissions and test the firms behavior without the need for a fully functional backend.
